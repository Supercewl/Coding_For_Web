      <h3 class="a1h">Dharma</h3>
      <p>My name is Dharma Kannan. I'm 63 years old.
        My house is in the northeast section of Morioh,
        where all the villas are, and I am not married.
        I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department 
        stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at 
        the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally
        drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I 
        get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. 
        After having a glass of warm milk and doing
        about twenty minutes of stretches before
        going to bed, I usually have no problems
        sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, 
        I wake up without any fatigue or stress 
        in the morning. I was told there were no 
        issues at my last check-up. I'm trying 
        to explain that I'm a person who wishes 
        to live a very quiet life. I take care 
        not to trouble myself with any enemies, 
        like winning and losing, that would cause 
        me to lose sleep at night. That is how I 
        deal with society, and I know that is what 
        brings me happiness. Although, if I were to 
        fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>
